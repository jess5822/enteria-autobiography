  <p><mark><b>Juste Rini M. Enteria</b>, born on September 22, 2004, in the City of Sorsogon, grew up surrounded by love and family values. As the fourth of five siblings, her childhood was filled with laughter, lessons, and dreams that shaped her into the determined person she is today.
<br>
<br>
Her father, <b>Rene G. Enteria</b>, a dedicated police officer known as "Enteng," was a symbol of strength and discipline. Born in Bulusan, Sorsogon, he was a man of integrity and duty. Juste’s mother, <b>Joy M. Enteria</b>, from Victorias City, Negros Occidental, was a force of nature—resilient, strong-willed, and endlessly loving. To Juste, her mother wasn’t just her guide; she was her hero, a beacon of warmth and wisdom.
<br>
<br>
At just four years old, Juste began her journey of learning at <b>Sorsogon Pilot Elementary School</b>, where she discovered the joys of reading, writing, and solving puzzles. Her curiosity and love for learning blossomed as she formed her first friendships and built a foundation for her future.
<br>
<br>
In 2016, she entered <b>Sorsogon National High School</b> and found a second home among her peers. At 15, she chose the Technical Drafting Strand, a path that allowed her to express her creativity through drawings that brought ideas to life. With her friends, she shared dreams of pursuing engineering, spending hours working on plates and imagining a bright future. But life, unpredictable and mysterious, had other plans for her.
<br>
<br>
By 2020, Juste completed Junior High and took her next step at the <b>Senior High Department</b> of <b>Sorsogon College of Criminology, Inc.</b> Her senior high years were a mix of joy and hardship. She met incredible people who became dear friends but also encountered betrayal that tested her resilience. Through it all, she remained steadfast. It was during this time she met <b>Jessica Ditan Jaramillo</b>, a kind, warm-hearted individual who brought love and light into her life. Jessica became not just a partner but a source of strength and comfort.
<br>
<br>
In 2022, Juste graduated from Senior High, marking yet another milestone in her story. Eager to continue her journey, she enrolled in the college program at <b>Sorsogon College of Criminology, Inc.</b> Now a second-year college student, Juste embraces every challenge with grace, driven by her belief that learning is a continuous process of life.
<br>
<br>
She has faced life’s twists and turns with an open heart, drawing strength from her family, friends, and her own unshakable determination. Her journey is far from over, and she carries with her the lessons of the past as she builds the future she dreams of—a future filled with purpose, growth, and endless possibilities.
